        <h3 class="title">About FTB Bank</h3>
        <h4 class="sub-title">Foreign Trade Bank of Cambodia (FTB) Company Profile</h4><br>
        <p1>
            The Bank was created following Sub-decree No. 1213 dated 10 October 1979 under the former regime of
            the
            State of Cambodia. In 2000, the Bank was separated from the direct management of the National Bank
            of
            Cambodia (“The Central Bank”) in order to transform its permanent identity into a state-owned
            commercial
            bank in Cambodia with the features of a Public Economic Enterprise and with the intention of
            conducting
            the autonomous business operation.

            In January 2001, the Bank obtained its banking license from the Central Bank to operate as a
            commercial
            bank in the Kingdom of Cambodia for a period of three years starting from 4 January 2001. This was
            the
            first license granted to enable the Bank to operate as a separate legal entity independent from the
            Central Bank's direct management. On 8 January 2004, the Bank obtained its 2nd banking license from
            the
            Central Bank for a period of three years starting from that date. The Bank now holds a commercial
            banking license, which was renewed for an indefinite period, on 21 December 2006.

            FTB is Cambodia's first and foremost bank. As Cambodia's private commercial bank, FTB has been
            providing
            customers with safe and reliable banking services for almost 40 years.
